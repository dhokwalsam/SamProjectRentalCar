Version 3.7 - 20161122

Discovered that the connection string example for "island" remote database example was causing confusion.
Difficult for students to adapt for their assignments.
Students are mostly using LocalDB

Therefore.
(1) Set this up to use LocalDB
(2) Provide commented-out connection strings for "island"


Catchup work 20170126 on the empty App "MVCManukauTech_v03.7_WithIdentityManage" to upgrade it to matching 3.7 specs:
(1) Connection String as above
(2) Session Object initialisation in "Global.asax.cs":"protected void Session_Start()" creating an OrderId of 0 like XSpy
